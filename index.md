## MainSwiftUI
With the help of this minimal Swift Package it is possible (read "favorable") to build, test, and execute top-level SwiftUI modules directly via Terminal. Applications with SwiftUI dependency would be typically reserved for the likes of Xcode. However, using the Terminal approach allows easier deconstruction of large applications needup to speedup builds.
